Description: zopyx.ipsumplone
        ================
        
        This package provides some browser view for creating demo
        content and demo images without reinventing functionality 
        for every new project.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``zopyx.ipsumplone`` to the eggs options of your buildout configuration, re-run
        buildout and restart your Plone instances.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        - ``@@new-site`` called in the context of the Zope root object or a Zope folder will
          create a new Plone site with a unique id
        
        - ``@@demo-content`` called in the context of the a Plone site will create
          a set of folder for images, news items and documents
        
        The main purpose of the package to call the views above inside the setuphandler
        or profile setup step to generate example content on request.  Please check the
        ``browser/setup.py`` implementation to figure out API methods like
        ``createDocument()``, ``createImage()`` or ``createNewsitem()``. Subclassing
        the ``Setup`` view is obviously a good start for own customizations.
